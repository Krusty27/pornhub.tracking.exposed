    <h4>(their description)</h4>
    <p>Pornhub is all about getting dirty, and so are we. But when it comes to the millions of tons of waste that wash up on our shores each year, we could all stand to clean up our act. That‚Äôs why we teamed up with them to create The Dirtiest Porn Ever: An adult film shot on one of the most polluted beaches in the world. And to help clean it up‚Ä¶ we want you to get down and dirty. For every view of this video, Pornhub will make a donation to Ocean Polymers to help them in their efforts to help preserve our oceans and beaches.

Unlike peer-to-peer for instance, a streaming portal like PH consumes CO2 because it provides new content every time, repeatedly üíî We understand that this has made the use more comfortable and makes you cum in less time, but let's remember that streaming pollutes and less time means less pleasure.

# Porn for women or women for porn? 

{{<pocrit
    leftId="women--stats"
    lefttitle="‚Äî Every year PornHub claims the amount of women grows among its consumers"
    rightcontent="That's OK, porn shouldn't be a man-entertainment only, but how do they count it if most of the accesses are without an account, and through incognito browsing?"
    textstyle=""
>}}

In the yearly review women are always mentioned and their presence is noted as _constantly growing_. Even in nations where internet is accessible mostly by men, even when a country has a +20% spike on connected people, PornHub tells us there is this organic growth. **Constantly**.

### That smells like bias (assuming good faith), please consider:

1. Pornhub delegated the gender-attribution to Google Analytics (ops, _Google keeps track of your PH activity, and Google Takeout does not include what they observe with Analytics!_).

2. By a preliminary experiment run by us, **if a user navigating with a clean browsing history** watches a lesbian video, they would likely be counted as a woman, regardless of who they are.

### Matrix of inaccuracy: take your guess!

# The December 2020 trainwreck 

A shitshow you probably know caused the [suspension of all PornHub payments from the Visa/Mastercard](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pornhub-mastercard/mastercard-to-stop-processing-payments-on-pornhub-cites-unlawful-content-idUSKBN28K30C) network, as a reaction to a [NYT piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html) [(more)](https://static.nytimes.com/email-content/NK_sample.html). We were working on these insights before [PornHub issued a formal response and a policy change](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002934613); 

{{<pocrit
    leftId="homepage--stats"
    lefttitle="‚Äî For the previous 7 years, PH used at least 25% of their homepage to test how random videos uploaded by people would perform"
    rightcontent="The issue here was the presence of non-consensual sharing of intimate material; the company between the 10th and the 14th of December tried to compromise, but how can you just filter abusive keywords when your full knowledge graph has learnt from abusers?"

### Insight is not open stats, is the new advertising

Pornhub produces many insights, among which "Year in Review", that are actually a wall of graph full of statistics where they celebrate their business. Journalists worldwide speak about them, without being too obvious that it has little to do with journalism, as much as unpaid advertising made to tickle sexual curiosity.

Indeed: an *Insight* in marketing terms is what a company applies in order to make a product or brand more appealing to customers.
We'd like to propose a different approach. People do the numbers. Companies are unfit to evaluate themselves, for obvious reasons of conflicting interests.

### PH does not seem to be very comfortable with communication theory, so we'd like to help.

In their 2017 insight, PH mentions Marshall McLuhan and his theory, ‚Äúthe medium is the message‚Äù, to pretend that they're investigating on media where porn is made available, discovering that it is a smartphone... We would like to correct them: **the medium where the porn is carried, is PornHub**. _It is the policy of the platform, allowing every kind of content to be uploaded, ignoring complaints on abusive material, using algorithms that test appeal of videos by showing them to random viewers._ That cesspool is your medium.

What Professor McLuhan has suggested, is that information is no longer an instrument for producing economic merchandise, but has itself become the chief merchandise. We found amusing that PH mentions his work without realizing how it would backfire (karma!)

## About us: _Are we the bigots!?_

Not really. Think about us as sex-positive algorithm-skeptic exploitation-angry.

[pornhub.tracking.exposed](/preview) is a browser extension that permits you to scrape the personalized content that PornHub delivers to you. We built it so you or dedicated researchers can get reliable data to talk about personalization algorithms.
To know more, check our [Manifesto](https://tracking.exposed/manifesto), but don't expect a lot of activity from our [twitter](https://twitter.com/trackingexposed?lang=en). We wish to coordinate some experiments (on [fb community page](https://www.facebook.com/personalizationalgorithm/) ü§∑), like the first [collective observation of pornhub algorithm](/potest/final-1), or the equivalent about [youtube](https://youtube.tracking.exposed/wetest/1). 

For more direct questions join our [mattermost](https://chat.securitywithoutborders.org/community/channels/trackingexposed) channel, check our AGPL code on [github](https://github.com/tracking-exposed), or mail _pornhub-team at tracking dot exposed_.

Details & know more

#### Pornhub follows the dynamics of a pseudo-social network, where independent content producers meet buyers. The reason they give so much attention to the new Verified Amateurs is because they are the *cheapest* way to attract new visitors.

The non-verified content uploaders are pushed on the homepage so strongly, compared to other platforms like YouTube, for two reasons:

1. Historically, Pornhub republished content filmed by others to attract visitors, and now they delegate this task to a community of random contributors who also want to gain visibility on the platform.

2. When an original content producer posts a recording, they should get feedback from the viewers to feel included and appreciated, even if they have a low viewership. Perhaps, in PH hopes, they'll become "verified amateurs" and thus engage more in these social dynamics, let fan come back more often, and serve them the 37% from the dying pron industry (which is kept alive and profitable only by PornHub infrastructure and visibility), and the 25% as part of their automated experiments.


#### On the women stats

* in [2019 they said 32%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2019-year-in-review#gender), [2018 = 29%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2018-year-in-review#gender), [2017 = 26%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2017-year-in-review), [2016 = 26%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2016-year-in-review), [2015 = 24%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/pornhub-2015-year-in-review),
* in [2014 was 23%](https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2014-year-in-review),
* in [2013 there was not MindGeek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MindGeek), the company owning PornHub had the name **MANWIN**, which as you can guess might not sound very inclusive. in October the name changed and so the rebranding started. It is not evidence, but this whole women friendliness also sounds like a marketing strategy.


#### On the enviromental impact calculation

We are using the conservative evaluation of 0.4 Kg of CO2 per hour of streaming. I'm sure there are more precise calculations, and we are not considering the additional impact caused by HD streaming and mobile networks. If you have a better estimate please let us know, we are following [this enviromental assessment](https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-what-is-the-carbon-footprint-of-streaming-video-on-netflix); at 720p one hour of streaming is 1.8 gigabyte [(calculation)](https://twitter.com/_vecna/status/1335273018013196298?s=20).
