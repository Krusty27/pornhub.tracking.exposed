## Since January 2019 we conducted a small series of experiment on the bigger website of porn industry. The tool we built initially to analyze [Youtube Algorithm](https://youtube.tracking.exposed), was a good starting point to analyze it since they are both streaming audiovisual content.

### Ideas for _researchers_

Understanding where and how the Pornhub personalization algorithm works, to identify the metrics, to optimize the tool and then to carry out higher level analyzes, for example about the impact that can have on sexuality. Can a personalization algorithm push towards a radicalization of the user towards a specific form of sadism?

Similarly to the test done by [fbTREX+WebFoundation, during the Argentinian G20](https://webfoundation.org/research/the-invisible-curation-of-content-facebooks-news-feed-and-our-information-diets/), or our [YouTube initial analysis](https://youtube.tracking.exposed/results) it is advisable to use simulated situations in order to bring our actors into a situation of divergence and study what factors are causing it.
